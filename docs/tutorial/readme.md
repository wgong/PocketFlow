## Demo


I've created a complete example script that demonstrates the Pocket Flow framework's capabilities with proper imports and additional features that would be useful for your ZiNets research. This script expands significantly on the basic example you shared, showing how the framework can be applied to Chinese character learning and exploration.

## Key Features Demonstrated in the Script:

1. **Basic Flow Control**: Shows how nodes can be connected and how actions determine which path to follow
2. **Retry Mechanism**: Demonstrates how nodes can automatically retry failed operations
3. **Batch Processing**: Shows how to process collections of items efficiently
4. **Shared Context**: Illustrates how data can be shared between nodes throughout execution
5. **Asynchronous Operations**: Demonstrates non-blocking execution for efficiency
6. **Weighted Connections**: Shows the custom extension for ZiNets with weighted relationships
7. **Proficiency-Based Learning**: Demonstrates how the ZiNets network adapts to different learning levels

## ZiNets-Specific Extensions:

The script includes two custom classes specifically designed for your ZiNets research:

1. **WeightedNode**: Extends the basic Node class to support weighted connections, which is perfect for representing the varying relationships between Chinese characters
2. **ZiNetsLearningFlow**: Adds proficiency-level filtering that can adapt the character network for different learners:
   - "intro": Only shows the 400 elemental building-block characters
   - "beginner": Shows common characters (high frequency)
   - "intermediate": Includes less common characters
   - "advanced": Includes rare characters

## Usage Examples:

The demo_weighted_connections() function provides a specific example of how your ZiNets research could leverage this framework:

1. It creates a radical node (æ°´/water)
2. Connects it to various water-related characters with weighted relationships
3. Demonstrates how different proficiency levels create different learning paths through the network

The framework's elegance comes from how naturally it maps to your research domain - Chinese characters form a directed graph with weighted relationships, which perfectly matches the core design of the Pocket Flow framework.

When you run this script, you'll see the various demonstrations executed sequentially, including the ZiNets-specific weighted connections demo that shows different exploration paths based on proficiency level.

This should provide you with a solid foundation for implementing your ZiNets prototype using the Pocket Flow framework. The lightweight nature of the framework (just a few hundred lines of code) combined with its powerful abstractions makes it ideal for modeling the complex relationships in your character network research.


## FAQ 


### Why does the framework use `exec()` and `_exec()` methods?


#### Claude's response: 
You're right to be confused by that design pattern. Let me explain why the framework uses this approach with `exec()` and `_exec()`:

The separation between the public `exec()` method and the internal `_exec()` method serves an important purpose in this framework's design:

1. **Extension Point**: The public `exec()` method is intended as a clean extension point - it's where you implement the core node logic without needing to worry about retry logic or error handling.

2. **Framework Logic**: The internal `_exec()` method provides a place for the framework to add functionality around your core logic:
   - In the base `BaseNode` class, `_exec()` simply calls `exec()`
   - In the `Node` class, `_exec()` adds retry logic around `exec()`
   - In the `BatchNode` class, `_exec()` adds batch item processing
   - In the `AsyncNode` class, `_exec()` adds async functionality

This pattern allows the framework to separate your business logic (in `exec()`) from the framework's own execution control logic (in `_exec()`). It's a form of the [Template Method pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_method_pattern), where `_exec()` is the template method that defines the skeleton of an algorithm, while `exec()` is the hook method that you override to implement specific behavior.

For example, when working with the framework, you'd typically only need to override the `exec()` method:

```python
data_processor = Node()

def process_data(data):
    # Your custom processing logic here
    return processed_result

# Just override the exec method with your function
data_processor.exec = process_data
```

While internally, the framework ensures this function gets wrapped with retry logic through the `_exec()` method.

This separation makes the framework more flexible and allows derived classes to enhance the execution behavior without requiring you to change your core logic.
