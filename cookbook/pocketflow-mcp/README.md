# PocketFlow MCP Demo

This project shows how to build an agent that performs addition using PocketFlow and Model Context Protocol (MCP). It presents a comparison between using MCP and basic function calling approaches.

This implementation is based  on the tutorial: [MCP Simply Explained: Function Calling Rebranded or Genuine Breakthrough?](https://zacharyhuang.substack.com/p/mcp-simply-explained-function-calling)

## Features

- Mathematical operation tools through a simple terminal interface
- Integration with Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- Comparison between MCP and direct function calling
- **Simple toggle** between MCP and local function calling

## How to Run

1. Set your API key:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
   ```
   Or update it directly in `utils.py`

2. Install and run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python main.py
   ```

## MCP vs Function Calling

To compare both approaches, this demo provides local function alternatives that don't require MCP:

- **Toggle with a simple flag:** Set `MCP = True` or `MCP = False` at the top of `utils.py` to switch between MCP and local implementations.
- No code changes needed! The application automatically uses either:
  - MCP server tools when `MCP = True`
  - Local function implementations when `MCP = False`

This allows you to see the difference between the two approaches while keeping the same workflow.

### Function Calling
- Functions are directly embedded in application code
- Each new tool requires modifying the application
- Tools are defined within the application itself

### MCP Approach
- Tools live in separate MCP servers
- Standard protocol for all tool interactions
- New tools can be added without changing the agent
- AI can interact with tools through a consistent interface

## How It Works

```

The agent uses PocketFlow to create a workflow where:
1. It takes user input about numbers
2. Connects to the MCP server for mathematical operations (or uses local functions based on the `MCP` flag)
3. Returns the result

## Issues:
### add tool

```python
@mcp.tool()
def power(base: int, exp: int) -> int:
    """Calculate base a to exponent b"""
    if base == 0:
        raise ValueError("base zero is not allowed")
    return pow(base, exp)
```

It failed for "power of 2 to 3"
